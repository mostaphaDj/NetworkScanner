# NetworkScanner
Network Scanner (or IP Scanner) is an open-source and cross-platform network scanner designed to be fast and simple to use. It scans IP addresses and ports as well as has many other features.

It runs on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X, possibly supporting other platforms as well.

The distinctive and innovative feature of the project is that it enables you to develop extensions that are implemented when the IP address finds a detected device, for example,  the open ports check extension, the vulnerability scanning extension, or any extension you want to implement on the IP address of the detected device.
